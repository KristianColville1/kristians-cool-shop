For the design phase, you are to introduce and describe the problem/system/situation that you plan to implement. And, construct
a Conceptual Data Model (ER diagram) and Logical Data Model (set of relations).

## [Design Document Deliverable](https://tutors.dev/lab/setu-hdip-comp-sci-databases-2025/topic-00-Assignments/unit-1-assignment-1/book-00-Assignment/Design#design-document-deliverable)

This document outlines the design and implementation plan for the
database. At this stage, the database should be modelled, and the
necessary supporting documentation must be prepared. The report is
expected to follow the structure below:

**Title Page**

The title page should include the report’s name, the student’s name and number, the module name, and the submission date.

**Table of Contents**

A clear table of contents should be provided, listing the main sections
of the report along with their corresponding page numbers.

**System Description**

This section should describe the objects of interest within the system
and explain how they are related. Additionally, include sample queries
or transactions that the database should be able to handle or generate.

**Conceptual Data Model**

Develop a data model that demonstrates sufficient complexity by
incorporating relevant relationships and associations. The model must
include binary relationships and at least one advanced concept (e.g.,
multivalued attributes, recursive relationships, subtype/supertype
structures, or weak entities).

**Logical Data Model**

Translate the conceptual data model into a logical data model by mapping it into a set of relations.

## [Submitting the Design document](https://tutors.dev/lab/setu-hdip-comp-sci-databases-2025/topic-00-Assignments/unit-1-assignment-1/book-00-Assignment/Design#submitting-the-design-document)

* The design document should be submitted in an electronic format through Moodle by 11pm on  **Sunday October 26** .
